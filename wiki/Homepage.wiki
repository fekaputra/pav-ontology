PAV is a lightweight ontology for tracking *Provenance, Authoring and Versioning*. PAV specializes the W3C provenance ontology [http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ PROV-O] in order to describe authorship, curation and digital creation of online resources.

== Overview ==

[http://pav-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2.1.1/images/pav-overview-755px.png]

PAV supplies terms for distinguishing between the different roles of the agents contributing content in current web based systems: contributors, authors, curators and digital artifact creators. The ontology also provides terms for tracking provenance of digital entities that are published on the web and then accessed, transformed and consumed. In order to support broader interoperability, PAV specializes the general purpose [http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ W3C PROV provenance model (PROV-O)].

PAV distinguishes between the data related to the digital artifact - named _Provenance_ - and those related to the actual knowledge creation and therefore to the intellectual property aspects â€“ named _Authoring_. The _Versioning axis describes the evolution of digital entities in time.

Using PAV, descriptions can define the Authors that originate or gave existence to the work that is expressed in the digital resource ([http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/authoredBy pav:authoredBy]); 
curators ([http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/curatedBy pav:curatedBy]) who are content specialists responsible for shaping the expression in an appropriate format, and contributors (super-property [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/contributedBy pav:contributedBy]) that provided some help in conceiving the resource or in the expressed knowledge creation/extraction.

These provenance aspects can be detailed with dates using [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/curatedOn pav:curatedOn], [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/authoredOn pav:authoredOn], etc. Further details about the creation activities, such as different authors contributing specific parts of the resource at different dates are out of scope for PAV and should be defined using vocabularies like PROV-O and additional intermediate entities to describe the different states.

For resources based on other resources, PAV allows specification of direct retrieval ([http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/retrievedFrom pav:retrievedFrom]), import through transformations ([http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/importedFrom pav:importedFrom]) and sources that were merely consulted ([http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/sourceAccessedAt pav:sourceAccessedAt]). These aspects can also define the agents responsible using [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/retrievedBy pav:retrievedBy], [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/importedBy pav:importedBy] and [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/sourceAccessedBy pav:sourceAccessedBy]. Version information can be specified using [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/previousVersion pav:previousVersion] and [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/version pav:version].

The creation of the digital representation, for instance an RDF graph, can in many cases be different from the authorship of the knowledge, and in PAV this digital creation is specified using [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/createdBy pav:createdBy], [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/createdWith pav:createdWith] and [http://purl.org/pav/html#http://purl.org/pav/createdOn pav:createdOn].

The goal of PAV is to provide a lightweight, straight forward way to give the essential information about authorship, provenance and versioning, and therefore these properties are described directly on the published resource. As such, PAV does not define any classes or restrict domain/ranges, as all properties are applicable to any online resource.

== Versions ==

PAV 2.1 updates PAV 2.0 with PROV-O specializations and more detailed descriptions of the defined terms. Note that PROV-O is not imported directly by this ontology as PAV can be used independent of PROV. PAV 2 is based on PAV 1.2 but in a new namespace ( http://purl.org/pav/ ). Terms compatible with 1.2 are indicated in this ontology using owl:equivalentProperty.

The ontology IRI http://purl.org/pav/ always resolve to the latest version of PAV 2. Particular versionIRIs such as http://purl.org/pav/2.1 can be used by clients to force imports of a particular version - note however that all terms are defined directly in the http://purl.org/pav/ namespace. See [Versions] for details.
